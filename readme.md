Snake
=====

This snake like game is for now a small school project just to mess around with python and [pygame](http://pygame.org).  
We haven't worked with python prior to this game to please bear with the code-horror.

Usage:
------

    usage: snake.py [-h] [-p PLAYERS] [-g GRID] [--fullscreen] [-b BLOCK]
    
    Small snake game for many players
    
    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -p PLAYERS, --players PLAYERS
                            Number of players (default: 1)
      -g GRID, --grid GRID  Grid size (default: 100)
      --fullscreen          Fullscreen (default: False)
      -b BLOCK, --block BLOCK
                            Block size (default: 5)
                          
For now we're trying to implement LAN multiplayer for an unlimited number of players.
